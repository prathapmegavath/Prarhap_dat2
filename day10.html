        <summary>What is html?</summary>
        <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It consists of a series of elements or "tags" that define various parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other multimedia.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Why do we use html?</summary>
        <p>HTML is used to create and organize content on the web. It helps structure text, links, images, and other elements so browsers can display them correctly. Itâ€™s essential for making websites accessible, improving search visibility, and working with styles and interactivity.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>What is doctype in html?
        </summary>
        <p>The <!DOCTYPE> declaration in HTML is used to specify the version of HTML that the document is using. It tells the web browser how to render the page correctly.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>What is the root element of html?
        </summary>
        <p>The root element of an HTML document is the <html> tag. It encompasses all the content of the webpage and serves as the main container for everything in the document.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>What is a tag?
        </summary>
        <p>A tag in HTML is a special markup element used to define and structure content on a webpage. Tags are usually enclosed in angle brackets, like this: <tagname>. Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag (e.g., <p>) and a closing tag (e.g., </p>), with the content in between</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Give me a few examples of self-closing tags?
        </summary>
        <p>Here are a few examples of self-closing tags in HTML:

            Image: <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
            Line Break: <br>
            Horizontal Rule: <hr>
            Meta Tag: <meta charset="UTF-8">
            Link Tag: <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
            These tags don't need a closing tag; they stand alone.
            </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summaryWhat is an element?></summary>
        <p>An element in HTML is a combination of a start tag, content, and an end tag. It represents a specific part of the webpage, such as a paragraph, heading, or image.

            For example, in this paragraph element:<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
            <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>How many types of elements are there in html?
        </summary>
        <p>
            HTML elements can be grouped into a few main types:
            
            Block Elements: Take up the full width and start on a new line. Examples:
             
            <p> 
            Inline Elements: Do not start on a new line and take only the space they need. Examples:
            
            <span>
            <a>
            <strong>
            Self-Closing Elements: Do not have a closing tag. Examples:
            
            <img>
            <br>
            <hr>
            Form Elements: Used for creating forms. Examples:
            
            <input>
            <button>
            <select>
            These types help organize and display content on a webpage.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary> What is d/f b/w the inline vs block elements?
        </summary>
        <p>Block Elements start on a new line and take up the full width (e.g., <div>, <p>).
            Inline Elements do not start on a new line and only take up the space they need (e.g., <span>, <a>).
            In summary, block elements stack vertically, while inline elements flow within text.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary> What is d/f b/w the semantic elements and non-semantic elements?
        </summary>
        <p>Semantic elements clearly convey meaning and structure (e.g., <header>, <article>), improving accessibility and SEO. Non-semantic elements lack meaningful context (e.g., <div>, <span>), primarily serving layout purposes. Using semantic elements is generally recommended for better content clarity.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary> What are href vs src attributes?
        </summary>
        <p>The href attribute specifies the URL for linked resources, commonly used in <a> tags for hyperlinks. The src attribute specifies the URL for embedded resources, such as images in <img> tags or scripts in <script>. Essentially, href is for linking, while src is for embedding.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>What are the features of html 5?
        </summary>

    <details>
        <summary>    What are entities in html?
        </summary>
        <p>In HTML, entities are special codes used to represent characters that have specific meanings or are not easily typed. They ensure that the browser correctly interprets these characters. Here are the main types:

Character Entities: Represent special characters, such as:

&amp; for & (ampersand)
&lt; for < (less than)
&gt; for > (greater than)
&quot; for " (double quote)
&apos; for ' (single quote)
Numeric Entities: Represent characters using their Unicode or ASCII values, such as:

&#169; for Â© (copyright symbol)
&#x1F600; for ðŸ˜€ (grinning face emoji)
Entities are useful for ensuring that special characters are displayed correctly without interfering with HTML syntax</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>  What is div vs span?
        </summary>
        <p><div> and <span> are used to group content, but they have different roles:

<div>
Block-Level: Creates a new section that takes up the full width and starts on a new line.
Use: Great for larger areas, like sections of a webpage.
<span>
Inline: Stays in the same line as the text around it and only takes up as much space as needed.
Use: Good for styling small bits of text within a paragraph.
In short, use <div> for big sections and <span> for small pieces of text!</p>
    </details>
    <details>

        <summary>What command do we need to use to move the changes to staged changes?
        </summary>
        <p>To move changes to staged changes in Git, you use the command:

```bash
git add <file>
```

or to stage all changes at once, you can use:

```bash
git add .
```

### Explanation:
- **`git add <file>`**: Stages a specific file for the next commit.
- **`git add .`**: Stages all modified and new files in the current directory.

Once you've staged your changes, you can then commit them with `git commit`.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>How can you stage all files at a time?
        </summary>
        <p>To stage all files at once in Git, you can use the following command:

```bash
git add .
```

### Explanation:
- **`.`**: This dot represents the current directory, so this command stages all modified, new, and deleted files in that directory and its subdirectories.

Alternatively, you can also use:

```bash
git add -A
```

### Explanation:
- **`-A`**: This option stages all changes, including new, modified, and deleted files across the entire repository.

After staging, you can commit your changes using `git commit`.</p>
    </details>
<detail>
    <summary>What is the git push command and use of it?
    </summary>
    <p>The `git push` command is used to send your local changes to a remote repository (like GitHub).

### Basic Command

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

### Key Points

- **`origin`**: The default name for your remote repository.
- **`<branch-name>`**: The name of the branch you want to push, like `main` or `feature-branch`.

### Common Uses

1. **Upload Changes**: Share your local commits with others.
2. **Collaborate**: Keep the remote repository updated with your latest work.

### Example

To push changes from your local `main` branch:

```bash
git push origin main
```

For the first push of a new branch, you can use:

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

This sets up tracking for future pushes.</p>

    <detail>
    <summary>What is git commit command usage?</summary>
    <p>The `git commit` command is used to save your changes to the local repository. When you commit, you're creating a snapshot of your changes along with a message describing what you've done. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

### Basic Syntax
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### Key Options

- `-m "message"`: This option allows you to provide a commit message directly in the command line.
- `-a`: Automatically stage files that have been modified and deleted, skipping the need for `git add`.
- `--amend`: Modify the most recent commit, adding changes or changing the commit message.
- `-v`: Show the diff of changes in the commit message editor.
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be committed without actually making the commit.

### Example Usage
1. **Stage your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
2. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix bug in user authentication"
   ```

### Good Practices
- Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes made.
- Use the present tense (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").

This helps keep your project history organized and understandable!</p>

    <summary>What is a marquee tag?
    </summary>
    <p>The `<marquee>` tag in HTML is used to create scrolling text or images across the screen. This tag allows content to move horizontally or vertically, giving a dynamic effect to the webpage. However, it's important to note that the `<marquee>` tag is deprecated and not recommended for use in modern web development.

### Basic Syntax
```html
<marquee>Scrolling text goes here!</marquee>
```

### Attributes
You can customize the behavior of the marquee with various attributes:

- **`direction`**: Sets the scrolling direction (e.g., `left`, `right`, `up`, `down`).
- **`scrollamount`**: Controls the speed of the scrolling (default is 6).
- **`scrolldelay`**: Sets the delay between each scroll movement (default is 85).

    <summary> Can we use block elements in inline elements?
    </summary>
    <p>In HTML, it's generally not recommended to place block-level elements inside inline elements. Doing so can lead to unexpected behavior and rendering issues across different browsers. Here's a brief overview:

### Block Elements
- Block elements (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<ul>`) typically start on a new line and take up the full width available.
  
### Inline Elements
- Inline elements (e.g., `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, `<img>`) do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.

### Common Practice
- You should place inline elements within block elements, but placing block elements inside inline elements is not valid HTML and can cause issues.

### Example of Valid Structure
```html
<div>
  <p>This is a paragraph with <span>inline text</span>.</p>
</div>
```

### Example of Invalid Structure
```html
<span>
  <div>This is a block element inside an inline element.</div> <!-- Not recommended -->
</span>
```

### Summary
While technically some browsers might render block elements inside inline elements, it's not standard practice. Stick to placing inline elements inside block elements for proper structure and compatibility.</p>

    <summary>   What are d/f b/ abs vs real paths?
    </summary>
    <p>Sure! Hereâ€™s a simple explanation of absolute paths and relative paths:

### Absolute Paths
- **Definition**: A complete path from the root of the file system to a specific file or folder.

- **Example**: 
  - If you are in `/home/username`, a relative path to a file in `documents` would be `documents/file.txt`.
- **Note**: Changes based on where you are in the file system.

### Summary
